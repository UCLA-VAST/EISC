So far the Xilinx Vivado HLS has a bug on generating the correct reset signals for our the current hardware design of this kernel. Therefore, run the offloaded program once is ok but run twice will stuck the system. One possible solution for this is to hack the RTL code generated by Vivado HLS, however we currently do not have time to do so.

Thus, please reload image everytime before running the offloaded program.
